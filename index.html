      <li><h5>About me</h5></li>
      <p>I'm from Krak√≥w. I'm driven by curiosity, I love to be surpraised by wonderful view, great technology, nice people and new interesting things.
      </p>
      <li><h5>Why programming?</h5></li>
      <p>I was always bit geek girl, but when I start my career path I thought that I need to choose between people and technology. Now I know that I can connect both fields by making useful websites and applications.</p>
       <li><h5>Goals</h5></li>
      <p>My current goals are to make my first real website and my first working application.</p>
